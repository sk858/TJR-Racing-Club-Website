					<h2>About Formula SAE</h2>

					<p>FSAE stands for Formula SAE, or Formula Student in some countries. It was first held by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in 1979. As required in the contest, college students who go in for it should develop a race car with its displacement under 610c.c within one-year.</p>

					<p>The FSAE competition was departed into 2 parts: static events and dynamic events. Static events include Technical Inspection, Cost and Manufacturing, Business presentation, Engineering Design. Dynamic events are Acceleration, Skid Pad, Autocross, Endurance, Fuel Economy. The FSAE competition judges a race car by all these 9 parts. FSAE stands for Formula SAE, or Formula Student in some countries. It was first held by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in 1979.

					<h2>The impact of FSAE Around the World</h2>

					<p>FSAE has been a worldwide magnificent competition since it was first held 30 years ago. Up to 2016, 15 countries have been holding 20 FSAE competitions, including America, Germany, Australia, Japan, Italy and Brazil. The competitions consist of 3 groups: internal-combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles (only in America).</p>

					<p>America is the first country to hold FSAE competitions and at present, holds four competitions every year. Although Germany has Just started holding the competition few years ago, FSAE Germany has already become the top FSAE competitions in the world, and it attracts 120 universities from all over the world. FSAE was first introduced into China in 2010. Up to 2016, it has been held 7 times in China with great success. It includes competitions for both internal-combustion engine vehicles (FSC) and electric vehicles (FSEC).</p>

					<h2>FSAE in China</h2>

					<p>FSAE China (FSC) is a design and manufacturing competition for college students of automobile engineering and automobile-related majors. It is regarded as "the cradle of automobile engineers" . The first competition in 2010 was held by Society of Automotive Engineers of China together with 20 local universities. Professor Li Liguang, the leading mentor of our TJU racing team, was one of the FSC's co-founders, and Tong]! University was also one of the initial foundlng universities. Up to 2016, FSC has attracted almost every university with top automobile studies all over China. Due to too many entering applications, this is also the second year to hold competitions of internal-combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles separately. The former alone has 79 formula teams from both local and abroad, with nearly 2000 college students' participation. FSC aims to build up an academic platform which trains and selects elite college students to be the future engineers and leaders in automobile industry. Through thorough assessment, it helps to improve students' designing, manufacturing, marketing, team working 8L collaborating and costing control abilities, which cultivates college students on all aspects, accumulates backup talents for industry's long-term development and eventually forms the nation's industry to be extraordinary.</p>

					<p>FSC is a non-profit and social-benefiting activity. What we work for today will benefit our future. But this would not have happened without the great support from many automobile manufacture sponsors and unlversitles, as well as the government officials and other supporters from society. All the resources received will be well used in organizing, promoting the competitions and establishing champion prizes.</p>

					<h2>TJU Racing Team</h2>

					<p>TJU Racing Team was founded in 2007. It’ 5 attached to the School of I Automotive, Tongji University. There are 5 departments in our team: chassis, I powertrain, electrics, aerodynamics and administration. Our team has over 120 excellent members selected from schools and colleges of Automotive Studies, Economic & Management and Arts 81 Media,etc. We've been holding the spirits of innovation, persistence and cohesion in creating our dream racing cars as well as TJU Racing Team building our future.</p>

					<p>TJU Racing Team is a non-commercial formula racing team. It is mainly funded by the college and sponsors.

Besides, our team is a student organization with full independence; we have our own management system and operate independently. Our team has won public focus during these years. We' ve received interviews from the state-run CCTV, sina.com and many other media. Every year, we will be invited to visit and participate in various of exhibitions and activities.</p>

					<p>Through 9 years' endeavor, we' ve acquired experience in designing and building up to 9 racing cars by our hands. Since 2009, TJU Racing team has continuously been taking part in FSAE Japan for 8 years. In FSAE Japan 2016, TJU Racing took the lst place in Acceleration, 2nd in Skid-pad and 3rd in Suspension Design. in 2012, we sent some of our members to FSAE Germany to inspect and learn from their works. Since FSAE was first introduced into China in 2010, TJU Racing team has been playing an important role as the pioneer, promoting and also helping develop the competition. Since then, FSC has been held for 7 times, and our team has achieved lots of prizes. In FSC 2016, we've won the championship!</p>
